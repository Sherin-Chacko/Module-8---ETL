### Module-8---ETL

A) Overview:

The goal of this analysis is to create an automated pipeline that extracts, transform and loads data. This analysis consists of four parts, which begin with the extraction of data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. The entire process of ETL can be executed with a single call of the function extract_transform_load in the final Jupyter Notebook file "ETL_create_database". 

The ETL process consists of four jupyter notebook files:

  1) ETL_function_test.ipynb -- 
      -- Data is extracted from the website in CSV and JSON format files.
      -- Data is then transformed into Pandas dataframes.
      
  2) ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb 
  3) ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb
  4) ETL_create_database.ipynb
